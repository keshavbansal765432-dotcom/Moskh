                💋🧿It’s been eleven months, and I still smile every time I realize that I get to love you. Not in a loud, dramatic way  but in the quiet, everyday way that slowly becomes everything.
                💗You’ve turned ordinary moments into something I look forward to, and somehow made my heart feel calmer just by being here.💌<br>With you, love doesn’t feel heavy or confusing. It feels 
                warm, patient, and full of tiny moments that mean more than big words. 🫶🏻We’re growing  not perfectly, but honestly. Learning each other, choosing kindness, understanding, and holding on 
                even when things aren’t easy. And that’s my favorite part about us.🎀 Growing together, supporting each other’s dreams, laughing at silly things, healing where we’re broken, and becoming 
                better versions of ourselves side by side. Loving you makes me want to grow  not faster, not forced  just <br>together.🛐<br>These eleven months aren’t just memories to me, they’re proof that 
                something beautiful is being built slowly and sincerely.🧿 And if love is about finding comfort, trust, and a little bit of magic in one person, then I know this for sure I found mine in you.😭💗
